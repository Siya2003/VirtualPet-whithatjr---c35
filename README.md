
1. Playing character - controlled by player -pac man

2. Non playing characters - controlled by computer - ghosts

3. goal- The player has to control
the pacman to eat all the
yellow dots spread across
in the maze.

4. rules - - Pacman has two lives.
            - Pacman can eat the
            yellow dots spread all
            around the maze.
            - There are 4 Ghosts
            patrolling the maze. They
            can eat the Pacman when
            they see and catch it.
            - There are five power
            pellets kept in the maze.
            When the pacman eats
            them, all the ghosts turn
            pale and they can be
            eaten by the pacman.
            - Ghosts can be reborn
            after they are eaten.
            - Game is won when the
            pacman eats all the yellow
                dots in the maze.
            - Game is lost when
        Pacman loses both its
        lives.

5. balance - 4 ghosts patrolling vs
            Power pellets through
            which Pacman can eat the ghosts
6. adaptive- It gets harder to eat the
            dots as the game
            progresses because there
            are lesser dots and they
            are spread across

7. chance vs skill - The movements of ghosts
                are completely random.
                So whether the Pacman
                gets detected by the ghost
                has elements of chance
                involved.
                The skill of player is in
                quickly manoeuvring the
                Pacman away from the
                ghosts and eating all the
                yellow dots on the way.

8. feedback- - Player gets points
                depending on the
                dots/ghosts they eat.
                - Player loses life when
                eaten by the ghost.
                - Sounds in the game also
                give quick feedback to the
                player
